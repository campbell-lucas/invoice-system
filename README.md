# Invoice System
## Lucas Campbell Project

<p>In order to get the project up and running make sure you create a .env file and put your environment variables in the file. Template of the file can be found as .env-default<p>

<hr>

<p>The project is my take on an invoicing system where there are different accounts for different users. Collectors account can download invoices, see the clients in their portfolio and send emails to them<p>
<p>The sales manager account can create new customer accounts and create invoices for those customers. They can also do what the collector can do. Collectors are limited to what they can do with the help of access restrictions<p>
